          <h1>Instructions</h1>
          <h2>Basic Rules </h2>
           Each Othello piece has a black side and a white side.
           <p>On your turn, you place one piece on the board with your color facing up.</p>
           <p>You must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, is flanked by your pieces.</p>
           <p>All of the opponent's pieces between your pieces are then turned over to become your color.</p>
           <h2>Movements</h2>
           <p>A move consists of placing one piece on an empty square.</p>
           <h2>How to Capture</h2>
           <p>You can capture vertical, horizontal, and diagonal rows of pieces. Also, you can capture more than one row at once. </p>
           <h2>End of the Game</h2>
           <p>The game ends when:
           <p>-One player wins, by making his color dominant on the board.</p>
           <p>-The players agree to finish the game (as a resignation, or a draw). </p>
